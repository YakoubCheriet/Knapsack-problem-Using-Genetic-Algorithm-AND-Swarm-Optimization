# Knapsack problem Using Genetic Algorithm AND Swarm Optimization

Solving Knapsack problem with both Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with results comparison, using MATLAB.

I created a graphic interface to make it easy to use and practical when it comes to entering the various parameters and visualising the results at the end.

The "Generateur_Tests" allows creating different population sizes (different difficulties: Easy, Medium, and Hard) with the option to save them on a txt file so you can share them with friends/ colleagues and compare the results.

At the end of each test, you can see which Algorithm performs better based on the results show in the graph or table. Plus I created an Excel file that solves the given Knapsack problem and gives an exact solution using Macros. The point is, so we can compare both GA and PSO results with it and find which one is closer to the exact solution


Here are some of the screenshots:
